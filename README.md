# Cryptography
This repository keeps my university lab assignments for the Cryptography and Security course. Each directory contains a README.md file with an explanation of the objectives and implementation of the assignment.

## [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/Flexksx/Cybersecurity-Labs/tree/main/CaesarCypher)
A simple CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting strings using the Caesar Cipher. Also supports alphabet shifting.
## [Frequency Analysis](https://github.com/Flexksx/Cybersecurity-Labs/tree/main/FrequencyAnalysis)
A streamlit web-app for decyphering text sent with a letter substitution via frequency analysis of the letter and letter combination occurances in the ciphertext.
## [Playfair](https://github.com/Flexksx/Cybersecurity-Labs/tree/main/Playfair)
Another Python CLI tool for encrypting and decrypting strings using the Playfair algorithm. Supports alphabets of other languages than English too.
## [Data Encryption Standard - Substitution](https://github.com/Flexksx/Cybersecurity-Labs/tree/main/DataEncryptionStandard)
Implementation of the S-Box substitution step in the Data Encryption Standard algorithm.
